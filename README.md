# PMG GLP Code Challenge
csv_combine.py is a python program that can take mutliple csv files as command line arguements and then it will combine all of them into one big file. The program also adds a new column, to the new csv file, named 'filename' which will tell us from what file are we getting the particular row of data. The program also do some error checking to validate if the arguements are correct, the file types are csv and if the files are not empty.
# Testing
Run the code by typing the following command on terminal:
```python
python csv_combiner.py ./fixtures/clothing.csv ./fixtures/accessories.csv > combined.csv
```
The name of input and output files can be changed accordingly.
